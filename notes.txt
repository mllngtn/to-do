Why use "controller as"?

	It makes it more readable - instead of using $scope all the time, everything becomes dotted (main.title, for example), which means you can track everything back to its controller more easily.
	"Prevents scope bleed when using multiple nested controllers"

Why "var vm = this"?

	Because the meaning of "this" can change depending on context...
	"The this keyword is contextual and when used within a function inside a controller may change its context. Capturing the context of this avoids encountering this problem."

		$scope and what it does
		
		

1) TURN MY DAYS OF THE WEEK INTO A FACTORY (https://thinkster.io/egghead/ngfilter/)

2) RE-ORDER TASKS BY DRAGGING-AND-DROPPING IN THE DOM

3) DIRECTIVES: PROGRAMMATICALLY CHANGE AN ELEMENT'S ATTRIBUTES (https://thinkster.io/egghead/useful-behaviors/)



What it does right now:


1) Array of days

2) Add an untimed task to a day

3) Add a timed task to a day

4) Error message if day or task name are undefined

5) timed tasks display underneath untimed tasks, and are presented in time order

6) Delete a task


What it should also do:

7) drag-and-drop a task into a different day array

8) drag-and-drop an untimed task to a different position on its untimed task-list

9) edit (or delete) the time on a task

10) edit (but NOT delete) the task name

11) Hide the day divs when they are empty

12) Allow tasks without days to be added to a general 'to-do' list at the top


STUFF TO SPLIT INTO SEPARATE FILES:

1) add tasks

2) delete tasks

3) drag-and-drop

4)
