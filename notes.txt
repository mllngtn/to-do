1) Is there a more elegant way than [ctrl-dragDrop.js; line 106] to reference objects within objects within an array? (was trying to do it with dot notation - days.day.array works; days.day.array.text does not work)

2) How to test DOM manipulation? (for example, drag and drop)

3) Why do the Tristar tests not have to inject ($rootScope, $controller) all the damn time?







Why use "controller as"?

	It makes it more readable - instead of using $scope all the time, everything becomes dotted (main.title, for example), which means you can track everything back to its controller more easily.
	"Prevents scope bleed when using multiple nested controllers"

Why "var vm = this"?

	Because the meaning of "this" can change depending on context...
	"The this keyword is contextual and when used within a function inside a controller may change its context. Capturing the context of this avoids encountering this problem."

What it does right now:


1) Array of days
	Tested: done

2) Add an untimed task to a day
	Tested: done

3) Add a timed task to a day
	Tested: done

4) Error message if day is undefined
	Tested: done
	
5) Success message if day is defined
	Tested: done
	

6) timed tasks display underneath untimed tasks, and are presented in time order
	Tested: not needed (this is the view, not a unit test)

7) Delete a task
	Tested: done


What it should also do:

8) drag-and-drop a task into a different day array
