Why use "controller as"?

	It makes it more readable - instead of using $scope all the time, everything becomes dotted (main.title, for example), which means you can track everything back to its controller more easily.
	"Prevents scope bleed when using multiple nested controllers"

Why "var vm = this"?

	Because the meaning of "this" can change depending on context...
	"The this keyword is contextual and when used within a function inside a controller may change its context. Capturing the context of this avoids encountering this problem."
